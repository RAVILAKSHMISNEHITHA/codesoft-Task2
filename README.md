## Overview of the Project

### Project: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

**Objective**: Build a predictive model to estimate movie ratings using features like genre, director, and actors.

**Key Activities**:
1. Collect and clean movie data.
2. Preprocess and encode features (e.g., genre, director).
3. Train and evaluate models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
4. Extract insights (e.g., key factors influencing ratings).
5. Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.

**Technologies**:
- Libraries: 'pandas', 'numpy', 'scikit-learn', 'matplotlib', `seaborn`
- Platform: Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Deployment Tools: Flask/FastAPI

**Key Insights**:
- Identify features that impact movie ratings.
- Compare model performance and extract actionable insights.
- Gain experience in data science workflows and deployment.
